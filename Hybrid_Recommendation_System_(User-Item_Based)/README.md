It is based on filtering and sorting.  

Some types are given and explained below.
> - **Association Rule Learning**  
> - **Content Based Filtering**  
> - **Collaborative Filtering** 
>  - **Memory-Based Filtering**
>    - **User-Based Filtering**
>    - **Item-Based Filtering**

**Collaborative Filtering**  
"Collaborative Filtering is a technique used to identify relationships between pieces of data. This technique is frequently used in recommender systems to identify similarities between user data and items."
 - **Memory-Based Filtering**

  It makes recommendations by using the information of users with similar liking habits.
  
  - **Item-Based Filtering**  
  It is based on the similarity of the liking structures of the products. 
  
 - **Model-Based Filtering**  
 "In this approach, Collaborative Filtering models are developed using machine learning algorithms to predict userâ€™s rating of unrated items."
